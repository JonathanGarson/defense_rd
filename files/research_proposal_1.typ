*Firm innovation in the Defense Industry, and Spill-over Effect*])

= Introduction

These projects aim at understanding better the innovation system of the Defense industry in France, and its connection to the civilian industry.

== Project A : Defense R&D and Private R&D : mechanisms of crowding-in 
This first work has for objective to develop a clear analysis of the mechanisms of crowding-in of the defense R&D as identified in the literature @pallanteDoesPublicRD2023 @morettiIntellectualSpoilsWar2025. 

We propropose to explore different mechanisms of crowding-in effect:
- A first channel is *dual-uses goods* produced by firms. Most of the firms operating in the military industry also evolve in the civilian industry, and the high level of R&D they support in the military component of their business may translate into civilian goods @ruttanWarNecessaryEconomic2006@mazzucatoRiseMissionOrientedState2015. In that case, crowding-in effect might be due to additional researches necessary to transfer military technology to marketable goods.
- A second channel might come from credit constraint effects, that limit investment capacities @garicanoSurviveAnotherDay2016. Given that the *credit constraint* effect is stronger in the defense industry than in the civilian industries @belinRisqueFinancierEntreprises2006 military funding might play a crucial role in alleviating the constraint. This relax can be explained by the positive signal of obtaining a grant --- "certification effect". It might ease the access to classical banking credit. May also rise from a "funding" effect, being fund allows to develop prototypes of product, facilitating then further funding. However, the sense of the causality is not clear, credit constraint could also be explained by demand side factors (i.e. military firms evolve in a concentrated and monopsonistic market limiting future profits for innovative technology). Alternatively, another popular narative is bank discrimination due to conservative interpretation of CSR criteria @mouraLEtatDansFinancement2011 would punish investment in military sector.
- A third channel is the *local spillover effect*. If firms evolving in close technological industries expect to benefit from other firms innovation they may invest to either secure their own position or integrate other firms innovation in their own product or processes. In that case, local spill-over effect due to technological clusters are to be expected. The transformative effect of defense R&D are well documented in the U.S. cases, noticeably their crucial role in building technological clusters and orienting American innovation toward initially military products --- _spin-off_ @grossAmericaJumpStartedWorld2023.

== Project B : Spin-in & Spin-off in the Military sector

A focus on the opening of early financing for firms with dual uses goods product. In 2021 the governement has started financing the Defense Investment Fund (_Fonds Innovation Défense_) specialy targeted to innovative dual-uses firms in their early development stages and industrialization process.

== Project C : Anticipated Demand, Investment and Growth in the Military Industry 

An important aspect of the question is *anticipated demand* that firm will face in their investment choice. If firms obtaining government grant consider it as a future signal of demand for a specific good from the MoD then winning government fund is the same as facing "guaranteed demand". They are incentivize to top-up government fund to secure future procurement contract @belenzonGuaranteedMarketsCorporate2024. Further research have showed that demand for experimental product is crucial so that new technology can  grow to maturity and survive against more mature incumbant technology. Historically the MoD by their procurement in innovative equipments has played this "consumer in first resort" role to forster innovation @malerbaDemandInnovationDynamics2007 @moweryChapter29Military2010. Theoretical results from @belenzonGuaranteedMarketsCorporate2024 showed that larger firms with production capacities and upstream in the innovation channel are more likely to benefit from "guaranteed demand" mechanisms. Recent reforms of R&D funding that separate demand from R&D might lead to growth of SME.

== Project D : Credit Constraint, R&D, and firm's growth in the Defense Industry

An explanation for the R&D crowdin-in effect can be the cred. A natural experiment to this credit relax could be the creation of DefInvest fund which aims at supporting SME in their growth paths. Another natural experiment could be the Ukrainian war and surge in demand (or more easily the stabilisation of public procurement after 2015).

= Introduction
This research proposal aims at understanding better the innovation system that sustains the French military sector in its autonomy, but also contributes to the French national industry in both military and civilian activities.

= Project A : Defense R&D and Private R&D : mechanisms of crowding-in 
This first work has for objective to develop a detailed analysis of the mechanisms of crowding-in of the defense R&D. Indeed, if the importance of military investment in R&D has long been discussed in the literature, like @pallanteDoesPublicRD2023 @morettiIntellectualSpoilsWar2025 for the crowding-in effect of direct government subsidies on private R&D, or jump-start effect of military investment on growth and innovation @dracaReagansInnovationDividend2013 @mazzucatoRiseMissionOrientedState2015 @grossAmericaJumpStartedWorld2023, much less attention has been provided to the exact mechanisms at play in the innovation system. Therefore, we propose a quantified assessment of the role of differents innovations channels through which the French military innovation systems spills over various industries.

A first step of this paper, would be to provide rich descriptives facts about the structure of the French innovation system. For that we would use patenting on the most consistent set of companies in France. The main objective would be to recover the channels of knowledge transmissions in the French innovation sector. The idea would be to isolate the scientific content of defense companies (being purely defense or dual) patents and then measure back the provenance of these knowledge. It would clarify the scientific quality and use of scientific inputs in the French military industry while providing a first assessment of which companies integrate the most scientific knowledge and generate the most innovation #footnote([The closest exercise has been done by #cite(<acostaPatentsDualuseTechnology2018>, form:"prose") on the 100th biggest defense firm in the world, finding that industries operating in both civilian and military activites are the more likely to produce patents, and #cite(<fauconnetLintensiteScientifiqueInnovations2020>, form:"prose") on the scientific contents of Europe largest firms, including the defense ones, she found that they are less likely to incorporate scientific knowledge]). 

In a second time, we could map the innovation connection between the three key actors of the innovation systems as coined by #cite(<serfatiRoleLinnovationDefense2008>, form: "prose") in this milestone study: the DGA (_Direction Générale de l'Armement_), the scientific labs (ONERA, CEA, ESA), and the large defense companies (LDC)#footnote([These companies have been remarkly stable for the last 60 years: Nexter-KNDS, ADS, MBDA, Naval Group, Dassault, Thales, Safran, Ariane Group, Arquus, Technicatom.]), we propose to add an actor with the subcontracting firms which can bear important innovations when LDC mainly serve as "technological integrator" @fauconnetLintensiteScientifiqueInnovations2020.

Once we have reconstitued the FIS, the following step, would be to measure the impact on patenting activities and R&D activities of firms benefitting directly and indirectly of public R&D funds. The broad idea is just to obtain a measure of publicly funded R&D on crowding-in. This first empirical metrics would be a valuable milestone by providing an estimate at the firm and industry level of the crowdin-in/out effects#footnote([We are aware of the work of #cite(<morettiIntellectualSpoilsWar2025>, form :"prose"), their paper does not provide a clear analysis of the channels through which spillover effects occur in the French industry—an aspect that this study aims to unpack. Moreover, their findings are substantially larger than those reported in the rest of the literature, and their instrument is likely fragile to demand anticipation, potentially leading to an upward bias.]) of French R&D investment. 

Following, the methods developped by #cite(<bergeaudPublicLabsPrivate2025>, form : "prose") to distinguish the impact of public research lab on patenting and innovation activities in LDC and SMDE. We decompose our analysis in different channels : 
- A first aspect would be to distinguish direct *funding of publics labs vs private companies*. It would have at least two advantages over the current methodology used : first, it would control for the "anticipated demand effect" @belenzonGuaranteedMarketsCorporate2024 --- firms who obtain important government grants expect to win future procurement and then invest top-up public investment to secure future gains. This channel is important to understand and exploit but can bias upward our estimation. The second advantages of this approach would be to avoid "inverse causality" effects, firms that participate to public procurements may need to invest ex-ante in R&D which would once again bias upward the average crowdin-in effect. Examining the effects of funding public laboratories in defense-related industries would also yield valuable insights into the broader impact of public research funding on primarily industrial firms. It could shed light on the unequal access to frontier innovations across firms of different sizes, as well as the trade-off between supporting firms directly through tax credits (such as the _Crédit Impôt Recherche_) versus allocating direct public funds. Moreover, it would help determine whether small firms benefit more from research conducted in public laboratories or from that carried out within the large defense contractors (LDCs) for which they work.
- A second channel is the *local spillover effect*. Firms operating within clusters tend to agglomerate and innovate more intensively following the receipt of government grants. Industries collaborating with innovative firms may, in turn, benefit from these firms’ innovations—either by investing to secure their own market position or by integrating external innovations into their products or production processes. In such cases, local spillover effects arising from technological clustering are to be expected. The transformative impact of defense R&D is well documented in the U.S. context, particularly its crucial role in fostering technological clusters and steering American innovation toward initially military-oriented products—commonly referred to as spin-offs @grossAmericaJumpStartedWorld2023. 
- A third channel involves *dual-use goods* produced by both defense firms and civilian industries. Most firms operating in the military sector also engage in civilian production, and the high level of R&D they conduct for military purposes may spill over into the development of civilian good @ruttanWarNecessaryEconomic2006 @mazzucatoRiseMissionOrientedState2015. Distinguishing between the two provides valuable insights into which firms and industries the state can expect to generate spillover effects. If civilian industries operating in closely related technological patent classes do not benefit from defense R&D funding, this would suggest that most of the effects are concentrated in dual-use goods#footnote([Except if we consider that competition with dual production firms may encourage investment from fully civilian firms.]). In that case, the crowding-in effect may result from the additional research required to convert military technologies into marketable goods. Finally, the spillover effects of public R&D could be assessed through scientific citation measures, using the funding of military projects across different industries as a clear indicator of public support for private research.

= Project B : Credit Constraint, R&D, and firm's growth in the Defense Industry

A recurring comment on the French military industry (FMI) is its remarkably stable sets of actors, being public scientific agencies or LDC. The DGA, in charge of military procurement and technological guidance, often underscores the difficulty to let new actors emerge from its current procurement procedure. Indeed, SME have a difficult access to medium and large market (over 100K) given European regulation imposes open competition and high military standards tends to considerably increase the cost of participating to this open competition. These two factors, coupled with a difficult access to credit @belinRisqueFinancierEntreprises2006 limits development capacities of SME in the Defense industry and then both production and innovation capacities.

We propose to develop a dynamic model of firm growth featuring endogenous credit constraints that arise from limited access to larger markets, itself driven by exogenous entry costs shaping firms’ growth trajectories. The model serves primarily as a conceptual framework to guide the empirical analysis and to formalize the underlying mechanisms constraining the development of the FMI. Specifically, it aims to elucidate the potential trade-off between market access barriers induced by entry costs and the financial frictions associated with credit constraints.

// An explanation for the R&D crowdin-in effect can be the access to credit. Credit constraints tends to limit investment capacities @garicanoSurviveAnotherDay2016. Given that the *credit constraint* effect is stronger in the defense industry than in the civilian industries  military funding might play a crucial role in alleviating the constraint.

// There are multiple hypothesis to explore to explain the relatively more difficult access to credit of defense firms. This might be due to bank discrimination towards military companies due to conservative interpretation of CSR criteria @mouraLEtatDansFinancement2011 would punish investment in military sector. A complementary explanation can be the difficulty to produce protytpes and then obtain funding given the important R&D cost, and the uncertain nature of demand (especially if the good has no special civilian use). Hard to identify.

For the empirical part of the paper, a promising approach could be to identify credit constrained firms, its impact on their investment and growth strategy (R&D investment and firm dynamics). Following #cite(<garicanoSurviveAnotherDay2016>, form :"prose") we may use the difficulty to obtain credits for future investments and the obtention of a grant from BPI France as an exogeneous shock on credit constraint. Firms more constrained would shift part of their investment to more long-term or R&D investment now that their credit constrained is relaxed.

Depending on the findings we could see if the credit relaxed firms increase their probability of participating to public procurement, increase their production or export, or if the small size of the French military market is a more binding constraints that the credit one. We can test this last hypothesis by using a second natural experiment, the surge in military spending following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. We could then identify the demand effects of firms that benefited from credit relax in 2021, those who did not, and the pure magnitude of the demand effect. A natural concern with this last step would be that firms benefiting of credits are also different in nature in their production and then benefit even more of the demand shock since what they produce is more tailored to the operational need of the French armies. However, at this stage, we can reasonably argue that the invasion was a shock, largely unexpected, and that the need of the French armies have probably been reconsidered following the invasion#footnote([The French military doctrine specified in the 2023 "Livre Blanc" is a global reconduction of the previous one, with the nuclear deterence being at the core of the French military doctrine, though in practice incremental changes were implemented and are acknowledge and theorised in the last "Livre Blanc" published in 2025.]).

// In a second time trying to understand on aspect of the credit constraint that might come from demand side effect. Indeed, the defense market is characterized by a monopsonistic behavior from the state. But the state demand design is itself regulated by European norms of public procurement, making that above a certain market size threshold (100K) the state must organize an open procurement. It creates an exogeneous entry cost to medium and large market size for SME and which may lead to break firms growth dynamic (no possibility to acquire more capital through credit borrowing given that they cannot access to larger market). This limits both their size, production and research capacity. We then propose to compare parallel access to credit such as DefInvest Funds from the BPI to see the economic trajectory of those firms compared to not selected projects, it would answer the question of how much alleviating the credit constraints plays in the defense case.

// Access to credit would facilitate credit obtention by sending a positive signal of obtaining a grant --- "certification effect". It might ease the access to classical banking credit. May also rise from a "funding" effect, being fund allows to develop prototypes of product, facilitating then further funding.

= Project C : Anticipated Demand, Investment and Growth in the Military Industry 

An important aspect of the question is *anticipated demand* that firm will face in their investment choice. If firms obtaining government grant consider it as a future signal of demand for a specific good from the MoD then winning government fund is the same as facing "guaranteed demand". They are incentivize to top-up government fund to secure future procurement contract @belenzonGuaranteedMarketsCorporate2024. Further research have showed that demand for experimental product is crucial so that new technology can  grow to maturity and survive against more mature incumbant technology. Historically the MoD by their procurement in innovative equipments has played this "consumer in first resort" role to forster innovation @malerbaDemandInnovationDynamics2007 @moweryChapter29Military2010. Theoretical results from @belenzonGuaranteedMarketsCorporate2024 showed that larger firms with production capacities and upstream in the innovation channel are more likely to benefit from "guaranteed demand" mechanisms. Recent reforms of R&D funding that separate demand from R&D might lead to growth of SME.

Possibility to use _Fonds Innovation Défense_ comme expérience naturelle d'allégement de la contrainte financière.

// == Project D : Spin-in & Spin-off in the Military sector

// A focus on the opening of early financing for firms with dual uses goods product. In 2021 the governement has started financing the Defense Investment Fund (_Fonds Innovation Défense_) specialy targeted to innovative dual-uses firms in their early development stages and industrialization process.

// == Project E : 

// The importance of public procurement design on firm's growth. Open competition for procuremenet at the ceiling of 100k market size limits firms possible expansions, due to important entry cost.

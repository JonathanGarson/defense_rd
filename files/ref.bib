Our analysis uses 1.8 million U.S. patents and their citation properties to map the innovation network and its strength. Past innovation network structures are calculated using citation patterns across technology classes during 1975-1994. The interaction of this pre-existing network structure with patent growth in upstream technology fields has strong predictive power on future innovation after 1995. This pattern is consistent with the idea that when there is more past upstream innovation for a particular technology class to build on, then that technology class innovates more.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the generation of technological knowledge by leading companies in the defence industry. In particular, we test whether the characteristics of large defence companies are related to both the production of different types of patents (civilian, military and mixed), and the generation of dual-use technologies. To explore these links, we rely on economic data for the top 100 defence companies from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute database, and patent information from the Worldwide Patent Statistical Database. Our results show that the relationship between the production of civilian patents and the size of the company is positive and significant. However, this relationship does not hold for the production of military patents. Furthermore, the military commercial profile is unrelated to the generation of military patents. Regarding the involvement in dual-use technologies, firms engaged in dual-use are those with higher military sales, a greater number of employees and a larger number of patents (civilian, military and mixed) than those not engaged in dual-use. Furthermore, we found a skill effect (more involvement in dual-use per employee) in European firms compared to US firms. These findings help to identify which firms should be targeted by government policies if increasing dual-use technologies becomes a political objective.},

  abstract = {Policymakers increasingly use trade instruments to address national security concerns. This paper studies optimal policy for dual-use goods---items such as semiconductors or drones that have both military and civilian applications. We begin by empirically documenting that the regulation and trade flows of dual-use goods respond to changes in the security environment over time. To put structure on the defense externality, we introduce military procurement into a multi-country general equilibrium network model and add a military contest to the national welfare function. In a simple two-country case, optimal export taxes depend on a trade-off between the good's military centrality and its distortion centrality. Military centrality is a network-adjusted sales share to the foreign military; distortion centrality reflects taxation misallocation in the domestic economy from roundabout imports. Using U.S. defense procurement data, we construct a measure of military use across goods, which ranges from zero to one, by scaling the U.S. closed-economy military centrality by import demand elasticities. Our measure effectively evaluates policy restrictions and military content in trade flows. To quantify the macroeconomic magnitude of the consumption-security tradeoff, we calibrate our model to a potential U.S.-China conflict. The revealed preference estimate of the value placed on the probability of winning the conflict equals 2.5 times the annual U.S. GDP.},

The dynamics of innovation in defense-related sectors have been profoundly altered in response to the growing complexity of military affairs and technology, the consolidation of defense-related industries, the increasing competition between firms and the radical changes affecting defense budgets and policies. The long-term structural trends have transformed military innovation processes in two ways. On the one hand, they have triggered the intensification of dual-use technological development and increased the contribution of scientific research to military innovation processes. On the other hand, they have modified military innovation processes by reinforcing cooperation between installed players. Within the framework, military leaders are struggling with the integration of new technology into existing networks and weapon systems.},

Firms that demonstrate strong technological capabilities are rewarded with noncompetitive production contracts for the resulting products and services. Using newly assembled data on \$4.2 trillion in government procurement contracts from all federal agencies, matched to U.S. publicly traded firms, we document a ``crowding-in'' effect, where government R\&D contracts lead to increased investment in corporate scientific research. Firms co-invest with the government at the R\&D stage to enhance their chances of securing these lucrative production contracts. We develop a theoretical framework to explain when it is optimal for the government to bundle R\&D and production contracts. Our analysis shows that guaranteed demand can produce higher quality at a lower total cost for upstream R\&D projects when the R\&D firms have production capabilities. Our empirical results confirm these predictions. Additionally, we find that the crowding-in effect has weakened over time as the government has increasingly separated R\&D contracts from production contracts. We discuss the potential implications of this decoupling.},

These ideas are created via private investment and spread between firms. Firms face a choice between secrecy, which protects existing intellectual property, and openness, which facilitates learning from others. Their decisions determine interaction rates between firms, and these interaction rates enter our model as link probabilities in a learning network. Higher interaction rates impose both positive and negative externalities, as there is more learning but also more competition. We show that the equilibrium learning network is at a critical threshold between sparse and dense networks. At equilibrium, the positive externality from interaction dominates: the innovation rate and welfare would be dramatically higher if the network were denser. So there are large returns to increasing interaction rates above the critical threshold. Nevertheless, several natural types of interventions fail to move the equilibrium away from criticality. One effective policy solution is to introduce informational intermediaries, such as public innovators who do not have incentives to be secretive. These intermediaries can facilitate a high-innovation equilibrium by transmitting ideas from one private firm to another.},

  abstract = {US government spending since World War II has been characterized by large investments in defense related goods, services and R\&D. In turn, this means that the Department of Defense (DoD) has had a large role in funding corporate innovation in the US. This paper looks at the impact of military procurement spending on corporate innovation among publicly traded firms for the period 1966-2003. The study utilizes a major database of detailed, historical procurement contracts for all Department of Defense (DoD) prime contracts since 1966. Product-level spending shifts -- chiefly centered around the Reagan defense build-up of the 1980s -- are used as a source of exogenous variation in firm-level procurement receipts. Estimates indicate that defense procurement has a positive absolute impact on patenting and R\&D investment, with an elasticity of approximately 0.07 across both measures of innovation. In terms of magnitudes, the contribution of defense procurement to innovation peaked during the early Reagan build-up, accounting for 11.4\% of the total change in patenting intensity and 6.5\% for R\&D. This compares to a defense sector share in output of around 4\%. The later defense cutbacks under Bush Senior and Clinton then curbed the growth in technological intensity by around 2\%.},

In this paper, we suggest a more nuanced approach to secrecy in open innovation, drawing from Philosophy and Sociology. We have conducted a two-year research program in the defense industry, collecting data on the practices of concealment in open innovation activities. We found that focal actors utilize distinct cognitive techniques to decontextualize knowledge in the course of open innovation projects in order to safeguard secrecy while preserving mutual learning. Further, focal actors design contrasted relational approaches to secrecy with their open innovation partners. Such approaches are based on the positions of secrecy boundaries, which are internal or external to the relationship. In fact, actors intentionally make use of the reversible nature of secrecy, balancing inclusion and exclusion of knowledge in partnerships, to meet objectives that sometimes go beyond knowledge protection. Finally, we build on our findings to introduce a capability-based framework of secrecy management in openness processes. This framework, which we call Knowledge Discretion, suggests that actors overcome tensions stemming from secrecy and openness playing on the contextual depth and relational breadth of external knowledge sharing.},

We solve for the optimal R\&D allocation and show that a planner valuing long-term growth should allocate more R\&D toward network-central sectors, but this incentive is muted for countries receiving more foreign knowledge spillovers. We derive sufficient statistics for measuring the welfare impact of improving cross-sector R\&D allocation. Empirically, we build the global innovation network based on patent citations and evaluate R\&D allocative efficiency across countries. For the US, improving R\&D allocation could generate 8\% welfare gains.},

  abstract = {The history of a number of industries is marked by a succession of eras, associated with different dominant technologies. Within any era, industry concentration tends to grow. Particular eras are broken by the introduction of a new technology which, while initially inferior to the established one in the prominent uses, has the potential to become competitive. In many case new entrants survive and grow, and the large established firms do not make the transition. In other cases, the established firms are able to switch over effectively, and compete in the new era. This paper explores a model which generates this pattern and has focused on the characteristics of the demand. We argue that the ability of the new firms exploring the new technology to survive long enough to get that technology effectively launched depends on the existence of fringe markets which the old technology does not serve well, or experimental users, or both. Established firms initially have little incentive to adopt the new technology, which initially is inferior to the technology they have mastered. New firms generally cannot survive in head-to-head conflict with established firms on the market well served by the latter. The new firms need to find a market that keeps them alive long enough so that they can develop the new technology to a point where it is competitive on the main market. Niche markets, or experimental users, can provide that space.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the rise of state investment banks (SIBs) as lead funders of mission-oriented innovation in various countries' agendas regarding smart (innovation-led) growth, and not just fixers of `market failures'. The market failure justification for public finance fails to capture the active mission-oriented role that such banks are playing in shaping and creating markets, rather than just fixing them. In tackling innovation priorities and shaping new markets, these banks are developing new financial tools that also help to reform the financial system from within, addressing issues of short-termism and financialisation. This paper documents and analyses the roles of such banks, building on the Neo-Schumpeterian work on mission-oriented policies (that is, policies that aim to address societal issues or challenges). The paper presents a rich analytical description of mission-oriented investments in two of the leading SIBs: Brazil's BNDES and Germany's KfW. We discuss the directionality of the investments, the various tools used, and the lessons to be learned for evaluating these tools outside of a market failure framework.},

  abstract = {We examine the impact of government funding for R\&D---and defense-related R\&D in particular---on privately conducted R\&D and its ultimate effect on productivity growth. We estimate longitudinal models that relate privately funded R\&D to lagged government-funded R\&D using industry-country level data from OECD countries and firm level data from France. To deal with the potentially endogenous allocation of government R\&D funds, we use changes in predicted defense R\&D as an instrumental variable. In many OECD countries, expenditures for defense-related R\&D represent by far the most important form of public subsidies for innovation. In both datasets, we uncover evidence of ``crowding in'' rather than ``crowding out,'' as increases in government-funded R\&D for an industry or a firm result in significant increases in private sector R\&D in that industry or firm. On average, a 10\% increase in government-financed R\&D generates a 5\% to 6\% additional increase in privately funded R\&D. We also find evidence of international spillovers, as increases in governmentfunded R\&D in a particular industry and country raise private R\&D in the same industry in other countries. Finally, we find that increases in private R\&D induced by increases in defense R\&D result in productivity gains.},

An original data-set was built, thanks to the information from the Ministry of Defense (MOD), the French Customs Central and National Administration, the Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and all the most relevant organizations specialized in the development, production or maintenance, repair, and overhaul of military goods in France. Overall, the DIB turns out as being composed of about 1800 enterprises in France (subcontractors included), of which three-third are SMEs. Along with high market concentration ratios, these enterprises are characterized by a significant military/civil duality, high labor productivity rates, and intensity in Research and Development.},

  abstract = {Government military establishments have for generations exerted an important influence on technological change in most industrial economies. Nevertheless, although the influence of military activity (waging wars, acquiring weapons, training personnel) on technological change has been pervasive for centuries, the channels through which military activity influences innovation have changed significantly, just as the structure and scale of national military establishments and the industrial societies within which they operate have changed. The extensive literature on the role of the military in technological change is largely devoted to the second half of the twentieth century, a period characterized by massive expenditures by the governments of both industrial and centrally planned economies on military R\&D and procurement in ``peacetime.'' This chapter devotes the bulk of its discussion to the post-1945 period, and within this period, focuses mainly on US military R\&D programs. There is very little comparative work on the influence (or lack of same) on innovation of military R\&D programs supported by other NATO governments, which raises fundamental questions about the generalizability of the US experience that forms the foundation of this survey. One of the greatest gaps in the vast literature on military R\&D and innovation is the modest scope of comparative work.},

  abstract = {Defense R\&D represents the largest component of US public R\&D spending and historically has promoted a wide range of civilian innovations. However, the empirical evidence on the impact of defense R\&D is scant and it does not provide conclusive results on the possible crowding-in (-out) effects on private R\&D investment. Exploiting a longitudinal dataset linking public R\&D obligations to private R\&D expenditures for US states, we investigate the impact of defense R\&D on privately-financed R\&D. To address potential endogeneity in the allocation of funds, we use an instrumental variable identification strategy leveraging the differential exposure of US states to national shocks in federal military R\&D. We document considerable crowding-in effects with elasticities in the 0.11--0.14 range. These positive effects extend also to the labor market, when focusing on employment in selected R\&D intensive industries and especially for engineers.},
